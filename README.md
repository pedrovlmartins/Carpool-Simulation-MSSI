# Carpool Simulation

We used NetLogo as a multi-agent modeling environment
to create and simulate a carpooling city model. NetLogo is
well known to create the desired conditions to simulate social
and natural phenomena where the people behind the model
being created are free to set their rules and instructions that
all the agents must follow.

The user can change the following input variables:

 * Grid size
 * Number of cars
 * Number of passengers per car
 * Percentage of people offering his services for carpooling
 * Parking probability and how much time the cars remains parked
 * Accident probability and how much time it takes for the accident to resolve itself
 * Priority areas and what population percentage is stacked upon those areas
 
The user can also store a log with all the main events that happened during the simulation.

A paper has been written accompanying the simulation source code.

The project was developed in an academical context by me, [Pedro Fraga](https://github.com/pedrofraga) and [Lu√≠s Oliveira](https://github.com/luisoliveira8).
